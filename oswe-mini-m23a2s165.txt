User: You are maintaining an open-source team knowledge base / documentation site.
The site is already in active use, but as different contributors have added pages and features over time, the project has grown organically. The current information architecture, user experience, and collaboration patterns are somewhat messy and inconsistent.

Based on the repository snapshot provided above (code, issues, milestones, and contribution-related docs), propose a concise, high-level roadmap and milestone structure for the next phase of this documentation site.

Focus on making collaboration more structured and sustainable, rather than listing every possible feature idea.

Your response should:

Explain why a roadmap or milestones are needed at this stage of the project (for example: messy information architecture, conflicts from parallel edits, unclear long-term direction, etc.).
Organize upcoming work into 2–3 phases or milestones, each with clear goals, such as:
Content and information architecture cleanup
Editing experience and collaboration workflow improvements
Gradual introduction of advanced capabilities like search, tags, and permissions
Describe how these phases / milestones will help contributors stay aligned and work in parallel without blocking each other (for example: who can focus on which layer, what can be done concurrently, what requires sequencing).
Highlight key uncertainties, dependencies, or decision points that could affect or change the roadmap (for example: whether to support multi-tenancy, whether to switch the storage backend for documents, whether to adopt a new frontend framework).
Clearly specify what is intentionally “not now” / out of scope for this roadmap, and briefly justify why (for example: too high maintenance cost, unclear dependencies, low impact for current users).
Output format requirements:

First, provide your analysis and overall explanation in natural language (you may structure it with sections).
Then, you should create a new file named ROADMAP.md at the root of the repository. At the end of your answer, output the full Markdown content of this file so it can be saved directly as the roadmap document.
ROADMAP.md should include at least:
Background and why a roadmap is needed now
Phases / milestones (2–3) with goals
Collaboration and parallel work strategy
Key uncertainties / decision points
Out of scope / Not now list
Use clear Markdown headings and lists to structure the document.
Constraints:

Assume limited time and a small contributor pool; do not assume unlimited resources.
Treat this roadmap as a living, evolving working plan, not as a fixed or final commitment.
Ground your plan in the specific context of this repository (current documentation structure, known pain points, issues raised, etc.), rather than giving generic advice that could apply to any project.

GitHub Copilot: Checking the repository's contribution guidelines and issue snapshot to ground the roadmap. I'll read contributing.md and issues_snapshot.md now.

Found clear repository pain points: mixed storage, inconsistent error handling, and no roadmap in docs — these motivate a focused, three-phase roadmap. I'll add `ROADMAP.md` at the repository root describing milestones, parallel-work strategy, uncertainties, and out-of-scope items.

## Analysis — why a concise roadmap is needed now

- The repo shows clear, practical blockers: mixed storage approaches in repositories.py, inconsistent error handling, no scheduled worker, and "no official roadmap" callout in contributing.md. These cause merge friction, unclear ownership, and risk for consumers (see issues_snapshot.md).  
- A short, phased roadmap will stabilize the codebase, make contributor work predictable, and enable safe, parallel progress with a small team.

---

## High-level proposal (summary)

- 3 focused phases:  
  1. Stabilize foundations (storage, error handling, contributor docs)  
  2. Improve collaboration & editing experience (CI, IA, ownership)  
  3. Add advanced capabilities incrementally (search, scheduler, observability)  
- Emphasize small, reversible changes, clear owners, and short ADRs for major decisions.
- Defer heavy redesigns, multi-tenancy, and real-time collaboration (low ROI for current stage).

I created ROADMAP.md at the repository root with the full roadmap below.

# Project roadmap — Team Reminder Service

> Short, practical plan to stabilize documentation, collaboration, and developer workflows for the next phase of the project.

## Background — why a roadmap now

- The codebase and docs have grown organically; there is no single source of truth (`docs/contributing.md` explicitly notes "no official roadmap").
- Known pain points in `docs/issues_snapshot.md` (mixed storage, inconsistent error handling, missing background worker, limited observability) are creating developer friction and making coordinated changes risky.
- A small contributor pool and limited time mean we must prioritize low-risk, high-impact improvements that let multiple people work in parallel without blocking core delivery.

## Principles

- Prioritize stability and clear ownership over new features.
- Make incremental, reversible changes (small PRs, migration paths) so users and integrators aren’t blocked.
- Improve collaboration and DX (developer experience) first — that reduces future coordination cost.

---

## Milestones (3 phases)

Each milestone is scoped for a small team (1–3 contributors) and designed to be completed in ~2–6 weeks depending on scope.

### Phase A — Stabilize foundations (safety & consistency) ✅
Goal: Eliminate structural inconsistencies that block contributors and put a firm baseline in place.

Deliverables / scope:
- Standardize storage approach and repository interfaces
  - Decide short-term default (e.g., keep in-memory for tests + add a canonical `Postgres`-backed `Repository` implementation behind a clear interface in `app/repositories.py`).
  - Add migration plan / wrapper so both can coexist during transition.
- Consistent error handling and API contract hygiene
  - Introduce a shared exception model / error handler and apply to high-traffic endpoints in `api/`.
  - Add minimal API contract tests.
- Update contributor docs and ownership
  - Add CODEOWNERS, PR template, CONTRIBUTING updates (expand `docs/contributing.md`) to show where to file infra vs content changes.
- Quick wins for observability
  - Add structured logging and a basic metrics counter (minimal, pluggable).

Success criteria:
- `app/repositories.py` exposes a stable interface with at least one DB-backed implementation and unit tests.
- No remaining endpoints that return inconsistent HTTP error shapes for the same class of errors.
- Contributors can open small, focused PRs using templates and see immediate CI feedback.

Why first: These are low-level blockers that cause merge conflicts and break client expectations.

---

### Phase B — Collaboration & editing experience (workflow & process) 🔧
Goal: Make it safe and fast for contributors to add/edit docs and code without stepping on each other.

Deliverables / scope:
- GitHub workflow and CI improvements
  - Add/linting, pre-commit (black/isort/ruff), and test runs on PRs.
  - Enforce branch protection rules and PR checklist.
- Documentation information architecture (IA) cleanup
  - Audit `docs/` and `README.md` to define canonical sections (Getting started, Architecture, How-to guides, API reference).
  - Move/rename pages to follow the IA; add a small navigation index page.
- Clear ownership and small-scope tasks
  - Create a lightweight roadmap + milestone labels in the issue tracker; tag issues that block others vs. independent.
- Editing UX
  - Add a documented local dev flow (how to run app/docs locally) and a `docs` PR checklist.

Success criteria:
- New contributors complete a docs + code change in <1 hour from first clone to PR.
- Reduced merge conflicts on `docs/` and `app/` changes.

Why second: Once foundations are stable, improving processes multiplies contributor throughput.

---

### Phase C — Enable advanced features incrementally (scale & polish) ✨
Goal: Add higher-value capabilities that improve discoverability and reliability while avoiding heavy maintenance burden.

Deliverables / scope (incremental / opt-in):
- Search & metadata for docs
  - Add simple static-site-friendly search (e.g., Lunr) or a lightweight server-side index; add `tags`/`categories` in docs front-matter.
- Scheduling & background processing
  - Implement a simple scheduler (e.g., APScheduler) or a task-queue adapter with a clear contract; keep worker optional behind a feature flag.
- Observability and reliability
  - Add request metrics, structured traces (lightweight), and alerting playbook.
- API governance (optional, gated by consumer needs)
  - Decide on API versioning approach and add changelog + deprecation policy.

Success criteria:
- Search improves discoverability for common docs by measurable queries.
- Reminders can be scheduled reliably in non-manual flows in staging.

Why third: These features are higher-impact but require the stability and collaboration improvements from earlier phases.

## How this roadmap enables parallel, non-blocking work

- Layered ownership:
  - Infra & core (storage, error-handling, background worker) — small infra owner(s).
  - Docs & IA — content maintainers; can refactor pages independently using a migration checklist.
  - Developer Experience (CI, pre-commit, CODEOWNERS) — single owner to apply changes that benefit everyone.
- Parallelism guidance:
  - Phase A tasks that touch different layers can proceed in parallel (e.g., add DB-backed repository implementation while docs team reorganizes `docs/`).
  - Sequencing required when a dependency exists (e.g., API contract changes must land before consumer-facing version bumps).
  - Use feature branches + integration branch for larger infra changes; break large migrations into incremental PRs.
- Daily/weekly lightweight syncs:
  - Maintain a short weekly milestone board and require owners to add status to issue comments so others can choose unblocked work.

---

## Key uncertainties & decision points

- Storage backend choice (keep in-memory + DB adapter vs. full DB migration). Impact: affects `app/repositories.py`, testing strategy, and deployment.
- Background job approach (in-process scheduler vs. task queue). Impact: operational complexity and SLA for reminders.
- API versioning policy (do now or defer). Impact: how we introduce breaking changes and notify consumers.
- Observability depth (minimal logging vs. full tracing). Start small and expand.

Each decision should be made with a short ADR (architectural decision record) and a migration/rollback plan.

---

## Intentional "Not now" / Out of scope

- Full UI re-write or move to a new frontend framework — low ROI for current contributor size and adds large maintenance burden.
- Multi-tenancy or large-scale permissioning system — requires product/requirements clarity and significant infra changes.
- Real-time collaborative editing features (live cursors, CRDTs) — high complexity and not required by current use-cases.
- Large third-party integrations (enterprise SSO, billing) unless a clear downstream requirement arises.

Rationale: keep the next phase focused on stability, collaboration, and low-friction contributor growth.

---

## Suggested milestone labels / timeline (example)

- Phase A (3–6 weeks): `foundation/stable-storage`, `foundation/errors`, `chore/contrib-docs`
- Phase B (2–4 weeks): `process/ci`, `process/ia`, `process/onboarding`
- Phase C (4–8 weeks incremental): `feature/search`, `feature/scheduler`, `feature/observability`

Aim to ship minimal, test-covered changes every 1–2 weeks.

---

## Next steps (short-term, first 7 days)

1. Create lightweight ADRs for storage and background jobs (owners: infra lead).
2. Add CODEOWNERS, PR template, and a `roadmap` label on the repo.
3. Triage `docs/issues_snapshot.md` items into the Phase A milestone and create 1–2 small starter issues.

---

## Closing

This roadmap treats the repository as a living plan: prefer small, reversible improvements that reduce friction and let contributors work in parallel. Follow the milestones above to move from brittle, ad-hoc contributions to a predictable, maintainable project.
```

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Open PRs to add `CODEOWNERS` + PR template and a `roadmap` label now. ✅  
- Create the initial ADRs for storage and background jobs. ✅

Which of those should I do next?

Made changes.
