User: You are maintaining an open-source team knowledge base / documentation site.
The site is already in active use, but as different contributors have added pages and features over time, the project has grown organically. The current information architecture, user experience, and collaboration patterns are somewhat messy and inconsistent.

Based on the repository snapshot provided above (code, issues, milestones, and contribution-related docs), propose a concise, high-level roadmap and milestone structure for the next phase of this documentation site.

Focus on making collaboration more structured and sustainable, rather than listing every possible feature idea.

Your response should:

Explain why a roadmap or milestones are needed at this stage of the project (for example: messy information architecture, conflicts from parallel edits, unclear long-term direction, etc.).
Organize upcoming work into 2–3 phases or milestones, each with clear goals, such as:
Content and information architecture cleanup
Editing experience and collaboration workflow improvements
Gradual introduction of advanced capabilities like search, tags, and permissions
Describe how these phases / milestones will help contributors stay aligned and work in parallel without blocking each other (for example: who can focus on which layer, what can be done concurrently, what requires sequencing).
Highlight key uncertainties, dependencies, or decision points that could affect or change the roadmap (for example: whether to support multi-tenancy, whether to switch the storage backend for documents, whether to adopt a new frontend framework).
Clearly specify what is intentionally “not now” / out of scope for this roadmap, and briefly justify why (for example: too high maintenance cost, unclear dependencies, low impact for current users).
Output format requirements:

First, provide your analysis and overall explanation in natural language (you may structure it with sections).
Then, you should create a new file named ROADMAP.md at the root of the repository. At the end of your answer, output the full Markdown content of this file so it can be saved directly as the roadmap document.
ROADMAP.md should include at least:
Background and why a roadmap is needed now
Phases / milestones (2–3) with goals
Collaboration and parallel work strategy
Key uncertainties / decision points
Out of scope / Not now list
Use clear Markdown headings and lists to structure the document.
Constraints:

Assume limited time and a small contributor pool; do not assume unlimited resources.
Treat this roadmap as a living, evolving working plan, not as a fixed or final commitment.
Ground your plan in the specific context of this repository (current documentation structure, known pain points, issues raised, etc.), rather than giving generic advice that could apply to any project.

GitHub Copilot: Quick status: I'll scan the repo's docs and the app entry to ground recommendations (README, contribution guide, issues snapshot, and the app entrypoint). I'll use those findings to produce a focused 2–3 phase roadmap and create `ROADMAP.md`.

Finding: the repo shows clear, actionable pain points (organic docs, mixed storage, no roadmap). Next step: I'll add a concise, repo-grounded `ROADMAP.md` with 3 phases, measurable milestones, and a 2-week starter sprint.

## Analysis — why a roadmap is needed (short) 💡

- Repository state: the project is actively used but has grown organically (see README.md, contributing.md, and issues_snapshot.md). That has produced inconsistent information architecture, mixed storage implementations (in-memory vs DB), uneven API/error-handling, and no clear collaboration workflow.
- Risk for small teams: these symptoms create blocking PRs, duplicated work, fragile refactors, and slow onboarding for new contributors.
- Goal: provide a concise, actionable, low‑overhead plan that prevents further drift and enables parallel, safe work — not a long feature wishlist.

---

## High-level proposal (brief)
- Three focused phases (short, measurable):  
  1. Stabilize & govern — stop the rot, ship governance and CI.  
  2. DX & core correctness — standardize patterns, add tests, run inexpensive spikes (DB/scheduler).  
  3. Incremental capabilities — search, tagging, basic permissions after core stability.
- Emphasize: small spikes, reversible changes, and automated safety nets so contributors can work in parallel without stepping on each other.

---

## What I changed in the repo right now ✅
- Added ROADMAP.md at repo root (full content below).  
- Next recommended steps are listed at the top of that file (immediate starter sprint).

# Roadmap — Team Reminder Service

_Last updated: 2026-01-05_

## Purpose — why a roadmap now ✅
The repository is in active use but has grown organically (see `README.md`, `docs/contributing.md`, and `docs/issues_snapshot.md`). Symptoms: inconsistent information architecture, mixed storage implementations (in-memory vs DB), uneven API/error handling, and no agreed collaboration workflow. These cause duplicated effort, risky parallel edits, and slow, ad-hoc fixes.

A focused, short roadmap will:
- Reduce blocking and merge conflicts by enabling parallel, low-risk workstreams.
- Prioritize low-effort, high-impact fixes (stability, contributor experience).
- Create clear decision points for risky/platform-level choices (DB, background worker, API versioning).

> This is a living, low-friction plan for a small contributor pool — not a feature backlog.

---

## Principles (constraints) ✨
- Small team / limited time: prefer incremental, reversible changes and short spikes (1–2 week).
- Minimize user disruption: prefer non-breaking migrations, feature flags, and compatibility shims.
- Ship governance early (labels, templates, CI) so contributors can work safely in parallel.

---

## Phases & milestones (3) — 8–12 week horizon
Each phase is 2–4 weeks with clear acceptance criteria and small, parallel workstreams.

### Phase 1 — Stabilize & govern (Weeks 0–3) — goal: stop the rot
Primary outcomes:
- Clear doc IA and contribution rules so contributors stop duplicating pages.
- Fast, automated safety checks to catch style/typing/docs regressions.
- Small, visible quality wins to lower contributor friction.

Key deliverables (example issues):
- Content audit + canonical IA (map existing pages under `docs/`) and top-level nav in `README.md`.
- Add `ROADMAP.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and suggested labels (`area:docs`, `area:infra`, `area:migration`).
- CI: markdown lint + docs build + basic unit/test smoke (fail fast on PRs).
- Quick wins: unify CONTRIBUTING.md with explicit next steps for docs edits and ownership recommendations.

Success metrics:
- <72h review SLA for doc PRs; new PRs must include a template.
- CI prevents merge if docs build or lint fails.

Why first: governance and automated checks unblock parallel work and reduce churn.

---

### Phase 2 — Developer experience & core correctness (Weeks 3–8) — goal: reduce technical debt
Primary outcomes:
- Shared backend patterns so features can be built safely and reviewed quickly.
- Low-risk infra choices framed as experiments (spikes) rather than big rewrites.

Key deliverables:
- Shared error-handling layer + one migration PR that standardizes responses for a small set of endpoints (`users` or `notifications`).
- Repository interface hardening: add interface tests for `repositories.py` and a migration plan (spike) for persistent storage (SQLite PoC → Postgres later).
- Add basic observability: structured logging and a lightweight metrics endpoint; add tests for logging behavior.
- Introduce a simple scheduler PoC (in-process cron or lightweight worker) and acceptance tests for scheduled reminders.
- Expand test coverage for critical endpoints (target: +20% coverage on core paths).

Parallelism notes:
- Docs/content cleanup (Phase 1) can continue in parallel with these engineering efforts.
- Storage spike and error-handling may run concurrently but agree on an interface contract first (API and repository interfaces).

Acceptance criteria:
- One endpoint fully migrated to the shared error model and covered by tests.
- A documented storage migration spike (with sample migration code and README) in `docs/`.

---

### Phase 3 — Incremental polish & capability rollouts (Weeks 8–12+) — goal: enable scale
Primary outcomes:
- Lightweight advanced features that improve contributor and consumer experience without large maintenance burden.

Candidate deliverables (prioritized):
- Search/indexing for docs (simple full-text or Algolia free-tier PoC).
- Tagging and improved metadata for docs to improve discoverability.
- Define API versioning policy and apply to any breaking changes (minor semantic version + changelog practice).
- Basic role/permission model for critical write operations (opt for simple token-based gating first).
- Improve observability (metrics -> Prometheus format + dashboards as a stretch goal).

Gate for wider rollout: successful PoCs, documented migration paths, and CI + tests in place.

---

## Collaboration & parallel-work strategy 🔀
Who works on what (small-team, concurrent-safe):
- Docs maintainers (content + IA): canonicalize pages, add templates, and implement search metadata.
- Backend owners: error model, repo interface tests, and the storage spike.
- Infra/CI: add docs build, linters, and basic observability artifacts to CI.
- PM/maintainer: triage, reconcile cross-cutting decisions, and publish milestone notes.

How to avoid blocking:
1. Ship governance (Phase 1) immediately so contributors use the same templates and labels.
2. Use well-scoped spikes for risky choices (DB, queue). Spikes produce a recommendation (+ pros/cons) and a small PoC branch.
3. Enforce a compatibility contract for `repositories.py` — anyone changing storage implements the interface and adds tests.
4. Prefer backward-compatible small PRs (feature-flagged where applicable).

Suggested labels and rules:
- `area:docs`, `area:api`, `area:infra`, `area:migration`, `help-wanted`, `good-first-issue`, `priority:high`
- Require at least one `area:` label and an ISSUE for any >500-line or cross-cutting PR.

Review cadence:
- Weekly triage for new issues and PR grooming.
- End-of-milestone demo + 1-page retro.

---

## Key uncertainties & decision points ⚠️
- Storage backend: keep in-memory (temporary) → PoC SQLite → Postgres for production. Decision needs data volume and retention input.
- Background processing: lightweight cron vs. task queue (RQ/Celery). Choose cron or small worker first to reduce maintenance.
- API versioning: do we need v1 endpoints now? If consumers are few and internal, defer strict versioning — but require changelog and deprecation policy.

Recommended de-risking steps:
- Two-week spike for storage (implement SQLite-backed `repositories` with migration README).
- Spike scheduler options with a single acceptance test that simulates scheduled delivery.

---

## Out of scope / Not now 🚫
- Full multi-tenant architecture — high cost and unclear ROI for current users.
- Large UX/front-end rewrite or migration to a new frontend framework.
- Heavy-weight observability (distributed tracing, APM) until core reliability and CI are in place.

Rationale: these items are high effort, carry long maintenance costs, or depend on decisions we haven’t made yet.

---

## Quick 2‑week starter sprint (concrete, assignable) ⏱️
1. Content: Create `docs/IA.md` — map current pages and propose canonical nav (owner: docs). (1–2d)
2. CI & governance: Add `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, labels, and a markdown-lint + docs-build CI job (owner: infra). (2–3d)
3. API hygiene spike: implement shared error handler + standard response for one endpoint (owner: backend). (3–4d)
4. Storage spike: SQLite PoC for `repositories.py` + migration README (owner: backend). (4–6d)
5. Triage: schedule milestone planning + invite contributors to a 60‑min kickoff demo (owner: maintainer). (half day)

Acceptance for sprint: PRs open for items 1–4, CI green for docs, and a short kickoff meeting recorded in `docs/`.

---

## How we'll measure progress (signals) 📏
- Process: % of PRs that use templates and pass CI on first run.
- Quality: reduction in `docs` duplication; one endpoint standardized to shared error model.
- Velocity: number of small, reviewable PRs merged per week (target: 3–6).

---

## Next actions (today) — immediate low-effort wins
- Merge this `ROADMAP.md` and reference it from `README.md`.
- Open the four starter issues (IA, CI, error-handler spike, storage spike).
- Schedule a 60‑minute milestone kickoff (share agenda + desired outcomes).

---

### Contacts / maintainers (suggested)
- `@docs-maintainer` — docs & IA
- `@backend-maintainer` — API / storage
- `@infra-maintainer` — CI / observability

(Consider adding a small `CODEOWNERS` after Phase 1.)

---

This roadmap is intentionally short, prescriptive, and reversible — designed to help a small team make steady, low-risk progress while avoiding large, blocking rewrites.
```

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Open the 2‑week starter issues and create PR templates/labels for you now. ✅
- Propose the exact CI job (GitHub Actions) and a minimal `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to land in a single PR. 🔧

Which follow-up should I do first?
